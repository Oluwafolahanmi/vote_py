This Python script establishes a voting platform for students, enabling registration, login, and the casting of votes for various positions. It connects to a MySQL database to store student details and voting information, allowing for organized and secure data management. Students can register by providing personal details, receive a unique voter ID upon registration, and then log in to cast their votes. The script guides users through the voting process, displaying available candidates for each position and updating the database with each vote cast. It also offers options to view voting results either by department or overall, providing transparency and clarity in the election process.
